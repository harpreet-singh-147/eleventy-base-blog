Hi there! My name is Harpreet and i'm currently on an exciting journey learning web development. My goal is to become a skilled web developer in the future. I've been dedicating time to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and delving into frameworks like React.

My journey into web development is driven by my fascination with technology and its power to connect people and ideas. I'm eager to continue learning, growing my skills, and eventually contributing to exciting and meaningful web projects.
